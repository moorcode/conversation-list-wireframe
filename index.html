        <blockquote>This conversation was intense and I was resistant to alot of their ideas at first. To be honest, I'm still resistant. It's the kind of information that can shatter an entire world. I've heard about vaccines being used to make people infertile, like in India. I even watched a documentary called Maafa 21, I think, and learned about the syphillis experiment where the CDC and white coats purposely gave Black people syphillis just to see what happened...and they lied and said the shot was something good. I heard about Margaret Sanger and the whole deal with depopulation and putting a disproportionate amount of Planned Parenthoods in lower income neighborhoods. I get people do evil things to smaller groups, but this is the whole world. Are you telling me there are a "mighty" few who are trying to take over the whole world? I have to tak about this again. I just can't believe it...yet.</blockquote>
